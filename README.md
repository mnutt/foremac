Foremac
=======

Cocoa app to run your Procfiles.  Restart processes individually!

Known issues
============

  * PXSourceList can't seem to automatically expand the 'PROCESSES' folder.  When set to auto-expand, nothing appears.
  * Tasks run in the wrong environment and don't act like bash running from a shell
  * Task logs don't update automatically and auto-scroll.  They should really be in a custom TaskView.
